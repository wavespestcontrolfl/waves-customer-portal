# Pricing Engine — Logic Inventory

Single source of truth for what this engine prices, how, and with what constants. All values are pulled from `constants.js` unless noted. Update this file when constants shift.

**Engine entrypoint:** `generateEstimate(input)` in `estimate-engine.js` → orchestrates per-service pricing in `service-pricing.js` → applies discounts via `discount-engine.js`.

**Public callers:**
- `server/routes/public-quote.js` — homepage quote wizard (recurring only)
- `client/src/pages/admin/EstimatePage.jsx` — admin estimate tool (full coverage)
- `client/src/pages/QuotePage.jsx` — portal quote page (recurring only)

---

## 3. Pest Control

**Formula:** `max(floor, base + footprintAdj + additionalAdj + propAdj + ageAdj) × (1 + roachMod) × freqMult × urgency`

- `base` $117, `floor` $89
- `initialFee` $99 (marked "waived with annual prepay" — **copy-only; waiver not implemented in engine**)

**Footprint brackets (linear interp):** 800 −$15 · 1200 −$10 · 1500 −$5 · 2000 $0 · 2500 +$8 · 3000 +$14 · 4000 +$21 · 5500 +$31

**Additional adjustments:** indoor +$15 · shrubs moderate +$5 / heavy +$12 · pool cage +$10 / pool no-cage +$5 · trees moderate +$5 / heavy +$12 · complexity complex +$8 · nearWater +$5 · largeDriveway +$5 · attached garage +$5

**Roach modifier:** german 15%, regular 15%, none 0%

**Frequency discounts (v1 — currently live):** quarterly 1.00, bimonthly 0.85, monthly 0.70
**v2 (experimental):** quarterly 1.00, bimonthly 0.88, monthly 0.78

---

## 4. Lawn Care

**Formula:** bracket lookup by `(track, tier, sqft)` → linear interpolation between rows.

**Tiers:** basic 4x/yr · standard 6x · enhanced 9x · premium 12x

**Tracks:** `st_augustine` · `bermuda` · `zoysia` · `bahia` (bracket tables in `constants.js:LAWN_BRACKETS`)

**St. Augustine shade handling:**
- FULL_SUN: 0.75 lb N/1K, 3 N-apps, PGR + SpeedZone
- MODERATE_SHADE: 0.625 lb N, 2 N-apps, Pillar
- HEAVY_SHADE: 0.50 lb N, 2 N-apps, Pillar

---

## 5. Tree & Shrub

**Formula:** `max(floor, bedArea × materialRate) + labor + access`, targeting 43% margin.

| Tier | Freq | Material rate | Floor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard | 6x | $0.110/sqft | $50 |
| Enhanced (recommended) | 9x | $0.190/sqft | $65 |
| Premium | 12x | $0.220/sqft | $80 |

**Access minutes:** easy 0, moderate 8, difficult 15.

**Bed area estimate:** `lotSqFt × basePct + complexAdd` — heavy 25%, moderate 18%, light 10%. Capped at 8000 sqft.

---

## 6. Palm Injection

| Treatment | $/palm | Apps/yr |
|---|---|---|
| Nutrition | $35 | 2 |
| Preventive Insecticide | $45 | 2 |
| Combo | $55 | 2 |
| Fungal | $40 | 2 |
| Lethal Bronzing | quote (floor $125) | 2 |
| Tree-Age Specialty | quote (floor $65) | 1 |

**Minimum per visit:** $75. Not a WaveGuard tier qualifier. Gold+ members get $10/palm/yr flat credit.

---

## 7. Mosquito

**Area basis:** `mosquitoTreatableSqFt = lotSqFt - footprint - hardscape`. This is separate from lawn square footage because mosquito treatment includes beds, shrubs, fence lines, trees, shaded areas, and outdoor living edges. The bucket guardrail prevents moving more than one category below the gross-lot bucket until revenue impact is backtested.

**Formula:** `basePrices[mosquitoLotCategory][programIndex] × pressureMultiplier`, pressure capped at 2.0x.

**Base prices by treatable area × program:**

| Treatable bucket | Seasonal | Monthly |
|---|---|---|
| SMALL (<8k sf) | $90 | $90 |
| QUARTER (8k-12k sf) | $100 | $100 |
| THIRD (12k-18k sf) | $110 | $110 |
| HALF (18k-35k sf) | $125 | $125 |
| ACRE (35k+ sf) | $155 | $155 |

**Visits/yr:** seasonal 9 · monthly 12

**Pressure factors (add % to base):** trees heavy +15%, trees moderate +5%, complexity complex +10%, complexity moderate +5%, pool +5%, nearWater +10%, irrigation +8%, lot acre +15%, lot half +5%.

---

## 8. Termite Bait

**Install formula:** `stationCount × (stationCost + laborMaterial + misc) × installMultiplier` (1.75x) × `perimeterMultiplier`

- Standard perimeter 1.25, complex 1.35
- Station spacing 10 ft, min 8 stations
- **Advance:** $14 station, $5.25 labor/material, $0.75 misc
- **Trelona:** $24 station, same labor/misc

**Monitoring subscription:** Basic $35/mo, Premier $65/mo.

---

## 9. Rodent

**Bait score** = footprint ≥2500 (+2) / ≥1800 (+1), lot ≥20000 (+2) / ≥12000 (+1), nearWater (+1), trees_heavy (+1).

| Score | Plan | Monthly |
|---|---|---|
| ≤1 | Small | $75 |
| ≤2 | Medium | $89 |
| >2 | Large | $109 |

**Trapping:** base $350, floor $350, footprint and lot adjustments per bracket (see `constants.js:RODENT.trapping`).

**WaveGuard:** NOT a tier qualifier. Excluded from % discounts. $50 one-time setup credit for members.

---

## 10. One-Time Services

Standalone prices (customer not on WaveGuard). Applied via `pricePestControlOneTime` / `priceLawnOneTime` / `priceMosquitoOneTime` in `service-pricing.js`.

**Pest one-time:** `max($150, recurringPrice × 1.30)` — recurring price computed at quarterly cadence as anchor.

**Lawn one-time (per treatment):**

| Treatment | Multiplier | Floor |
|---|---|---|
| Fertilization | 1.00 | $85 |
| Weed | 1.15 | $85 |
| Pest | 1.30 | $85 |
| Fungicide | 1.45 | $95 |

Then × 1.30 standalone multiplier on top of recurring rate.

**Mosquito one-time (flat by lot):** SMALL $200 · QUARTER $250 · THIRD $275 · HALF $300 · ACRE $350

> **Note:** Public quote wizard (`public-quote.js`) is recurring-only. One-time and "not sure" frequencies divert to `/api/leads` (lead-webhook) for human triage — engine doesn't price them from the homepage form.

## 11. WaveGuard Tiers

Qualifies off count of **qualifying recurring services** bundled together:

| Tier | Min services | Discount |
|---|---|---|
| Bronze | 1 | 0% |
| Silver | 2 | 10% |
| Gold | 3 | 15% |
| Platinum | 4 | 20% |

**Qualifying services:** `lawn_care`, `pest_control`, `tree_shrub`, `mosquito`, `termite_bait`
**Non-qualifiers (still priced but don't count):** palm_injection, rodent_bait

**Excluded from % discount (flat credits instead):**
- `rodent_bait` — $50 setup credit
- `palm_injection` — $10/palm/yr credit (Gold+ only)
- `bed_bug_chemical`, `bed_bug_heat` — $50 flat member credit
- `bora_care`, `pre_slab_termidor` — fully excluded, no discount
- `german_roach_initial` — excluded to avoid double-dip with baked urgency/rc

**Recurring customer perk on one-time services:** flat 15% off. Does NOT stack with tier discount (recurring lines get tier; one-time lines get this perk; no line sees both). Bora-Care and pre-slab Termidor excluded from this perk too.

---

## 12. Specialty Services (summary)

All priced via margin-divisor formula: `price = cost / marginDivisor`. A `marginDivisor` of 0.45 = 55% target margin (margin is share of **price**, not markup over cost).

| Service | Margin target | Floor | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plugging | 45% | $250 | 6in/9in/12in spacing rates; $1.111/plug |
| Top-dressing ⅛" | 60% | $250 | sand $4.09, delivery $2.62 |
| Top-dressing ¼" | 65% | $450 | sand $4.09, delivery $5.24 |
| Dethatching | 60% | $150 | material $2.10/1K |
| Trenching | — | $600 | dirt $10/LF, concrete $14/LF; renewal $325 |
| BoraCare | 55% | — | gal $91.98, coverage 275 sqft |
| Pre-slab Termidor | 55% | — | bottle $152.10, 1250 sqft; volume disc 10+ 15% / 5+ 10% |
| Foam-drill | 55% | $250 | tiered by treatment points (5/10/15/20) |
| German roach (initial) | — | $400 (base $450) | $100 setup, footprint-bracketed |
| Bed bug chemical | 65% | $400 base + $250/extra room | $50.42/room material |
| Bed bug heat | — | $1000/$850/$750 by room count | + $150 in-house base |
| Flea initial | — | floor $185 (base $225) | follow-up floor $95 |
| Wasp | — | tiered $150/$250/$435/$775 | free with recurring pest |
| Exclusion | — | $150 | simple/moderate/advanced per-point ($37.50/$75/$150); inspection $85 |
| WDO inspection | — | — | ≤2500 $175 · ≤3500 $200 · >3500 $225 |

## 13. Payment Adjustments

**ACH discount:** retired (0%). Kept as a constant for legacy-caller safety.
**Card surcharge:** 3.99% added at checkout, not baked into engine output.

## TODOs in the engine (for v4.4 documentation)

`constants.js` flags several policy values as deserving written rationale:
- MARGIN_FLOOR 35% threshold justification
- URGENCY multiplier values (why 1.25/1.50/2.00)
- PEST base/floor anchor (market analysis vs historical)
- PALM per-palm pricing methodology
- TERMITE monitoring subscription pricing
- RODENT bait subscription pricing
- ONE_TIME 1.30x multiplier + floor rationale
- TREE_SHRUB 43% target vs 35% global floor
