// A payment_failed admin bell is about an invoice that was not collected. When
// the invoice becomes paid, the bell is obsolete, whichever PaymentIntent paid
// it (a customer who retries with a new card pays through a NEW PaymentIntent;
// payment-failure-notifications.js only suppresses when the SAME one settles).
//
// Called from completeActivePlansForInvoice (payment-plans.js), the one helper
// every paid/prepaid transition already runs on its way out, after its own
// locked read proved the invoice is paid/prepaid. Best-effort by contract: the
// close runs in a SAVEPOINT on the caller's connection, so a failure here rolls
// back only the close and is logged; it never fails or rolls back the payment.
//
// A bell matches the invoice by EITHER key:
//   - metadata.payload.invoiceId = the invoice (alerts raised after the stamp
//     fix in payment-failure-notifications.js carry it), or
//   - metadata.payload.paymentIntentId = the stripe_payment_intent_id of a
//     payments row whose metadata.invoice_id is the invoice (the failed
//     attempt's own ledger row; covers alerts raised before the stamp fix).
